docker - container virtualisation for Rails and associated technologies

If you wish to run Rails locally, you will need Ruby and Node installed,
using the versions above. A Ruby version manager succh as ```nvm``` is
recommended.

## Database

A postgres database is provided as part of the docker-compose cloud. If 
you want to access Postgres from Rails running on the host machine, you
can update your /etc/hosts file to add db as an alias for 127.0.0.1:

```sudo sh -c "echo '127.0.0.1  db' >> /etc/hosts"```

## Dockerfiles

"Dockerfile" is used for development, while "Dockerfile.Production" is 
used for deployment to production. If you need to make any updates to
the development Dockerfile, please also update Dockerfile.Production.

## Ruby and Node versions

Rails in run in a container in order to match the production 
environment. If you need to update the Ruby or Node versions, please
update in both Dockerfiles, as well as the .ruby-version and 
.node-version files, then rebuild your containers and run your tests.

```just setup```

```just start``` (or ```just up``` if you want to see logs)
